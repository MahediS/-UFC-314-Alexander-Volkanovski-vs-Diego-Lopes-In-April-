# -UFC-314-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-In-April-

 Kaseya Center, Miami. It’s for the vacant UFC featherweight title after Ilia Topuria vacated the belt to ascend to lightweight. This bout means a lot for both fighters: Volkanovski seeking to reclaim his previous status and Lopes fighting for his first championship in the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who held the belt for more than four years and made five defenses. But he’s coming off consecutive knockout defeats — first to Islam Makhachev in October 2024 at 155 pounds, and then to Ilia Topuria in February 2024 at 145 pounds. It will be his first fight in more than a year after a 14-month layoff.
Motivation: Volkanovski is 36 and admitted this might be his last opportunity to win the title back. He has taken on the persona of “Old Man Volk,” wanting to show that he can still mix it up at the top level. He still believes he can outlast young opponents with experience and tactical acumen.


Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and momentum: Lopes (26-6) has won five in a row, beating Dan Ige and Brian Ortega, among others. Famed for his aggressive style and thunderous power, Lopes has skyrocketed through the featherweight divisions after first signing for the UFC less than two years ago.
Fighting Style: Lopes is a destroyer on the feet, and with elite jiu-jitsu skills, he is dangerous on the ground, as well. That said, there have been lingering questions about his cardio, though he did look better on that front in his most recent foes.
Victory
For Volkanovski: Experts advise Volkanovski to lean on footwork and strategy to sap Lopes' cardio. Steering clear of early exchanges in which Lopes, who has delivered some of the most dangerous blows of his life, is in his best form will be critical, as Volkanovski’s durability has been called into question after he suffered back-to-back knockout losses.
For Lopes: Lopes will need to take advantage of Volkanovski's recent gas tank issues, pressure him early, and leverage his power. His ability to blend striking with grappling could be a challenge for Volkanovski as well.
Fight Highlights
The UFC 314 card is among the most stacked events of the year:
Co-Main Event: Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett in a lightweight fight.
Other fights of note include Yair Rodriguez vs. Patricio Pitbull (featherweight), Jean Silva vs. Bryce Mitchell (featherweight), and Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates (welterweight)
Betting Odds
Despite those most recent defeats, Volkanovski comes into this one at a small favourite, around -150 ($1.67), while Lopes is a +105 ($2.20) outsider. Analysts view this as a hard-fought battle with major implications for both fighters’ careers.
This is an era vs. era fight: One Volkanovski’s experience and legacy vs. one Lopes’ youthful momentum and desire for a gold belt. Not only will the winner be the next featherweight champion, but the result will likely shape the future course of both fighters' careers.
